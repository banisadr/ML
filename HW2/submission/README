# README FILE
# Introduction to Machine Learning
# Assignment 2
#
# After completing the assignment, fill in this README file.  It asks you to duplicate
# your answer to several questions.  Be certain that your answers in this README file
# (which will be used for auto-grading) match the answers in your PDF writeup.
#
# This README file is formatted in YAML to allow it to be machine readable.  Please
# be very careful with how you edit it, being careful to following the formatting.
# Make certain not to change any text in all UPPERCASE.  After editing, you can make 
# certain that your README file follows proper YAML syntax by running it through an
# online YAML checker, such as http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
# 
# The most frequent error is multi-line strings, such as "SOURCESCONSULTED" and 
# "FEEDBACK_ERRORS".  Make certain that the previous line ends with a | followed by a 
# newline.  Then, make certain that the subsequent lines are indented one level in 
# (4 spaces).  This sounds complex, but just follow the existing format of this file.
# If you run into any problems that you can't fix easily in listing your sources or 
# providing feedback on the assignment, just include your multi-line string answers to
# these parts as comments.  Everything else (all simple one-word or numeric answers) must
# be properly formatted YAML.

# Answer to Implementation Exercise 2.3:  Analysis of the regularization parameter

# Copy and paste your brief paragraph describing the effect of the regularization 
# parameter from your PDF.
LOGREGIMPLEMENTATION_REGULARIZATION_ANALYSIS:
 Because there is a relatively linear split between the data, small changes in lambda do not seem to have huge impacts on the decision boundary. However, it is plan that increasing the value of lambda does increase the bias - in effect smoothing the result. Or in other words, a larger lambda makes the decision boundary less sensitive to individual pieces of data being miss-classified. This is because lambda acts as a penalty on thetas and as a result, larger values of lambda word to drive thetas to zero.

# Answer to Implementation Exercise 3.4:  Effect of Kernel Parameters
#######################################################################################

# Copy and paste your brief paragraph describing the effect of varying the kernel  
# parameters and C from your PDF.
SVM_KERNELPARAMETEREFFECTS:
  Low values of C cause the SVM to be highly generalized, or have high bias. This is because, in the opposite manner of lambda, C causes us to ignore theta and weight the miss-classification of points, so when C is zero, we see the inverse and put high weight on theta. As a result, with small values of C, we see a smooth form, while with large values, we see lower testing error. Similarly, increasing both the dimensionality, d and the gaussian gives us more flexibility in classifying the points in the space and results in a line that is less smooth (low bias) but has lower testing error.
